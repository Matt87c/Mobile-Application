# Mobile-Application

•	Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
 The requirements of this mobile application were to create an inventory management system with user login, CRUD functionality, and an SQLite database.    The user will be able to create, read, update, and delete new inventory items.  A notification will be sent to the user if an item is out of stock.
 
•	What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
The screens for this mobile application include a login and registration screen.  New users will register with their name, email, phone number and password.  Once the user has credentials, the user can login through the login screen.  The next screen will display the inventory.  This screen will allow the user to create, read, update, and delete inventory items.  The UI design is made for the user to easily tap on the screen to modify items.  Future releases will include a bar code scanner for users to be able to scan barcodes to import items.  The designs are successful because the user can register, login, and modify inventory as intended.

•	How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
My approach for coding this app was following the guidelines and incorporating each feature specifically.  Coding best practices are applied and in text notations are used to help explain the code.

•	How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
To ensure the code was functional, I ran the debugger and setup points to debug the code.  Thoroughly looking through the code to ensure no mistakes were made to ensure quality.

•	Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
The main challenges I had were meeting deadlines.  Developing this app in two weeks’ time frame is a challenge without a team of developers.  I had to study the Zybooks material to learn and reinforce Android Studio functionality.

•	In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The UI design was particularly successful in developing the mobile application.  I was able to design the app as intended with the functionality in mind.  Integrating the SQLite database for user logins was also successful.
